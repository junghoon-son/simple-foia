3. **Name specific offices/divisions** - Narrow the search scope
4. **Request electronic records** - Faster and cheaper
5. **Always request fee waiver** - Worst case: denied
6. **Set a fee cap** - Prevents surprise charges
7. **Keep copies** - Your request is a federal record
8. **Follow up** - Agencies miss deadlines; follow up in writing
9. **Appeal denials** - Administrative appeals are free and often successful
